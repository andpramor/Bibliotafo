<h1>Bibliótafo</h1>

Bibliótafo is a mockup e-commerce site for a library, serving both as an online shop, and as a webapp for the employers of the library to keep track of sales and validate them. 

I used Angular for the front end and Django with Django Rest Framework to develop the backend's API. MySQL takes care of the database.
